The project has a very simple implementation.  It is built in node.js and only requires the “net” package.  
It can be run by navigating to the project’s folder in a terminal window and running the command 

node index.js

If not already installed, node.js can be installed on a Linux virtual machine with the commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs

The node modules file is included in the repository because it is so lightweight.
